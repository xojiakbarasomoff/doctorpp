# inside this image and can't find either if they're left out. That step is
# configured per-service on the host rather than in a repo-level config
# file, so it runs once (on the web service) instead of racing a second
# copy of itself on the worker.

# One image, two roles. The web API and the arq worker run the same code
# and differ only in entrypoint, but a host that builds every service in a
# project from this one repo has nowhere per-service to put that
# difference: a committed start command (railway.json) applies to the whole
# repo and would silently make the worker a second web server. Environment
# variables *are* per-service, so the role comes from APP_ROLE. Unset means
# web, which keeps `docker run` and any host that knows nothing about
# APP_ROLE doing the obvious thing.
#
# docker-compose.yml overrides `command:` for its worker and never reaches
# this dispatch.
#
# Shell form (not exec-array) so ${PORT:-8000} actually expands: hosts
# inject PORT at runtime and expect the container to bind to it, while
# local `docker run` (no PORT set) falls back to 8000. `exec` replaces the
# shell so the process gets SIGTERM directly on shutdown instead of the
# shell swallowing it and the platform resorting to SIGKILL.

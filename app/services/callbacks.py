"""Patients who asked to be rung: "menga qo'ng'iroq qiling, raqamim ...".

These land on the dashboard's "Nomer" screen as leads, each with the
patient's handle, their number, and a line saying what the call is about --
so whoever rings them does not open the conversation cold.

Two ways in, in order of preference:

1. The assistant marks the request itself, in the reply that confirms the
   call: [[CALLBACK:+998901234567|buyrak og'rig'i bo'yicha maslahat]]. The
   reason is then a short summary in the patient's own language, written by
   the same model call that answered them -- no extra call, no extra cost.
2. When the reply carries no marker but the patient plainly asked to be
   called and typed a number, the lead is still raised from their own words.
   A request the model forgot to mark is a patient nobody rings, and that is
   the failure this module exists to prevent.

A patient who is being booked gives their number too; that is a booking, not
a callback, and is left to the appointment book.

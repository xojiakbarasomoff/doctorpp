"""The conversation store: who is talking to a clinic, and what was said.

Shared business logic, deliberately platform-neutral. Nothing here mentions
Instagram or Telegram — a channel arrives as an id plus its type string, and
the patient as whatever id that platform issued. Both bots record their
traffic through this one module, so a clinic's conversation history is a
single table's worth of rows however the patient reached it, and neither
adapter grows its own copy of "find or make the user, find or make the
conversation, append the message".

Before this existed the Instagram pipeline persisted nothing at all: the
User/Conversation/Message models and their repositories were written but
never called, so every reply was generated from a single message with no
history, the operator-takeover flag on Conversation could never be read, and
the reply-window check had no real timestamp to measure against.

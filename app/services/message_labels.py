"""The lines the system writes into a transcript in the patient's place.

A patient who sends a photo, a voice note, a video or a reel has not written
anything, but the clinic still needs to see that they did -- so the inbound
edge records a short label instead: "📷 Rasm yubordi", "🎞 Video yubordi".
Those labels are the system's words, not the patient's, and everything that
reads the patient's words for meaning -- which language they write in, what
their complaint is, whether they said thanks -- has to skip them. Kept here,
in one place, so a new kind of label cannot be added without every reader
learning to skip it.

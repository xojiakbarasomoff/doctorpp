"""Reminding patients about an appointment before it happens.

Ported from the Telegram worker's cron job, onto the shared delivery path so
a patient is reminded on whichever platform they booked through rather than
only on Telegram.

Five things are different from the version this replaces, and all five were
ways a patient could silently not be reminded:

* A reminder is marked sent only when it actually went out. The original set
  the flag unconditionally, so any appointment it could not deliver to was
  recorded as reminded and never tried again.
* It sends with the clinic's own channel credentials, resolved from the
  patient's channel. The original sent everything with one global bot token,
  which is wrong the moment a second clinic exists.
* It asks the database for the appointments that are due instead of loading
  every future appointment in the system and filtering them in Python.
* A patient reachable on Instagram is reminded too.
* A booking made at short notice gets one reminder, not two at once. The
  original's fixed 22-26h and 1-3h windows also meant a reminder was lost
  outright if the worker happened to be down when its window passed; these
  are catch-up windows instead.

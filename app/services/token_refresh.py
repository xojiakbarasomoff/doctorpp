"""Keeping Instagram channel tokens alive.

An Instagram Login token lasts sixty days. Nothing renewed them, so every
deployment carried a date, unmarked in any calendar, on which the clinic's
Instagram would stop answering -- with no error to read, because a channel
with a dead token fails the same way as one nobody has messaged.

Meta's renewal takes the current token and returns a new one good for another
sixty days, which makes this a maintenance job rather than a migration: run it
often enough and the expiry never arrives. Daily is far more often than
needed, and that is the point -- sixty days of missed runs are survivable,
where a weekly job that breaks in December is not noticed until February.

Two of Meta's conditions shape the code below. A token must be at least
twenty-four hours old to be renewable, so a channel configured this morning is
skipped rather than treated as broken. And an already-expired token cannot be
renewed at all: past that point somebody has to reconnect the account by hand,
which is why that case is logged at error rather than counted as a failure to
retry.

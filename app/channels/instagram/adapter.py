"""Instagram's implementation of the ChannelAdapter contract.

Holds the two rules that are Meta's, not ours: a channel whose credential is
still a placeholder cannot send at all, and a standard text send is only
allowed inside the 24-hour messaging window. Both used to live in
app.workers.tasks, where they were reached only by the Instagram path and
would have had to be duplicated (with different constants) for Telegram.

"""The dashboard's JSON API.

Ported from the Telegram side, onto the shared core and behind the session
auth the operator dashboard already used. Two things changed in the move,
both of them holes rather than features:

* The tenant is taken from the logged-in operator instead of from a
  `tenant_id` query parameter that defaulted to 1. Any authenticated
  operator could previously read and modify another clinic's patients,
  appointments and conversations by changing that number.
* Writes require the session's CSRF token in a header (see
  app.api.admin.deps), matching what the server-rendered dashboard already
  did with a hidden form field.

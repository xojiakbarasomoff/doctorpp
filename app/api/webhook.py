"""Instagram's inbound edge.

This module and app.channels.instagram are the only places that know what an
Instagram webhook payload looks like. Its job is narrow on purpose:
authenticate the delivery, parse it, work out which channel it belongs to,
and hand each genuine message to the shared services — the conversation
store, then the debounce buffer. Everything after that point (retrieval,
the answer prompt, delivery) is platform-neutral and shared with
the Telegram bot, so this file is roughly what a Telegram webhook route will
mirror rather than duplicate.
